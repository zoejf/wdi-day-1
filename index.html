<h1>Homework: Day 1 (June 22)</h1>
<br>
<h2>Questions and Things I Learned From Internet Readings</h2>
<ul>
	<li>There is an Engineering Task Force that created a new version of IP addresses (IPv6) that will include enough IP addresses for use into the future; there is are also groups that create HTML and other language protocols</li>
	<li>The Internet is very resiliant: Since packets follow the past of least resistance, and have multiple paths by which they can reach their destination, many sections of the internet could go down and packets could still reach their desinations.</li> 
	<li>How would you create a new IP address, or connect to a server with a new device that has never been connected before?</li>
</ul>
