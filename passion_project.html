<h2>My Passion Project - Education Tools Web Site</h2>
<p>Through my experiences working at a school, and now as I become a student again after many years, I realize there are so many different learning tools available now. I’d like to create a web site where students (of all ages and stages of life) can share tools, tips, support. The site would include public lists of tools for a variety of different categories. Categories could include distraction-free, time management, financial aid and applications, and subject-specific tools. People could also create a user account in order to save/bookmark tools, join support “chat rooms,” post new tools they find, and connect to other users.  The overall goal would be to support lifelong learning. </p>
